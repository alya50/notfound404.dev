                Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my articles, contents etc.

            <p>
                I'm an 18 yo person. I choosed programming as my career. I work 80 hours per week myself to learn everything I can to create new projects. From web development to machine learning I like to learn new things. I love computers, seeing how powerful binary can be. I have many other hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games.

                Also, I'm not going to school and have no certificate because I think Turkey's education system is so bad and getting worse. As a citizen of Turkey, I can say school is just a waste of time for both companies and students.
