                Hello, welcome to my personal website. This website about me and my articles, contents etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm 18 years-old fullstack developer. I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps and backend services. I'm interested in kotlin and web development. I like to learn new things and I love computers. I have many other hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games.

                Also, I'm not going to school and have no certificate because I think Turkey's education system is so bad and getting worse. As a citizen of Turkey, I can say school is just a waste of time for both companies and students.
